# Digimon World Next Order More Education Mod

This mod gives the option to force an education action (praising, scolding) after a certain amount of in-game time if an action is not triggered by the game normally.

A config file is available after the first execution with the mod in the BepInEx's plugins folder.

You can configure the amount of time until an action is forced so you can give the game time to trigger its own and balance the game as you see fit. The minimum time between actions is still 2 in-game hours as defined by the game itself, and the default configuration for the mod adds another 2 hours, meaning every 4 hours an action will be forced to happen if the game didn't automatically trigger one (whenever an action is triggered by the game or this mod the timer is reset).

Note that this mod will force an education action while in the training hall, unlike vanilla where you'd need to change map for one to trigger (if it did trigger).
